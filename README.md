This is NOT the official version, this will be deleted soon.

This version of AhMyth only has a modified client/payload, the client updates and upgrades were made by HiddenPirates (Thank you [HiddenPirates](https://github.com/HiddenPirates) your client work is truly inspirational üòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è) which was merged with the offical maintained repository located [here](https://github.com/Morsmalleo/AhMyth).

any other version of AhMyth including this one, is an unnoficial offshoot unless the developer of said offshoot either wants to merge their features into the offical maintained repo or if they agree to once I ask them if its ok to do so (Yes thats right, AhMyth may be my project [No I did not create it, I am the only that maintains it] but I will not take credit for someone elses work just because someone has implemented a feature in their own unnoficial offshoot that the offical version doesn't have)
