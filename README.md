# AhMyth-Modified-Version

AhMyth is an popular open source android rat. But the official AhMyth contains many bugs. For an example, you can't fetch victim's files from the remote server using official AhMyth. So that we have modified the rat and remove all bugs and also added some extra features. 

(Please star ‚≠ê mark this project to support)
(Please guys use this project for good purpose only. Otherwise I will remove this project from from my repository.)

### It consists of two parts :

- Server side : desktop application based on electron framework (control panel)
- Client side : android application (backdoor)

## Features
- GPS Logging
- Microphone Recording
- View Contacts
- SMS Logs
- Send SMS
- Call Logs
- File Explorer & Downloader
- Built In APK Builder
- Camera Access

## What's new and fixed bugs
- Fetch files bug fixes
- Device administrator permission added that normal users can not uninstall the payload
- Fetching victim's location bug fixes
- The name of the apk file has been changed to Google Play Service so that the victim does not understand that it is a payload.
- Also has been changed the apk icon.
- Android 12 supported
- App icon will hide if the victim's phone's android version is below android 10. (That's why device admin permission added to prevent uninstallation)

## Notice
 - Due to the background limitation of Android 8 or higher, the started service has been removed and the foreground service has been added. So you should turn off the application's notification from the settings. If victim's phone is under Android 8 then you can skip this step.

## Prerequisites
- Java 8 (to generate apk backdoor)
